# built-in data types can't represent some real world objects, like computers or phones or machines
# With Classes and Objects, we can create our own data types for these, each with their own functions!

# Say, we want to represent a student
# First, we create a new file ("student.py") with the Student class

# from student.py, import class Student
from student import Student

# Recall class init being: def __init__(self, name, major, gpa, is_on_probation)
#student1 & 2 is the object that uses class Student
student1 = Student("Jim", "Business", 3.1, False)
student2 = Student("Pam", "Art", 2.5, True)

# The . allows us to access attributes of an object
print(student1.name)
