# Done by the "import" keyword (.py extension not needed)
# Here, usefulTools is a .py module we created ourselves

# HOW TO INSTALL EXTERNAL/3RD PARTY MODULES (pip):
'''
Pip is a package manager that lets us install/update/uninstall python modules
    Some versions have it pre-installed, but some versions don't have it
    - Can check on Command Prompt with "pip --version"
    To install pip, type "pip install python-docx"
    - "python-docx" can be replaced with any module we want to install
    To then use the module, in the editor, type "import docx"
    
    To uninstall a module, in command prompt, type "pip uninstall python-docx"
    - again, "python-docx" can be replaced with any module we want to uninstall
